The chatrooms are accessed through the main "Menu" and then "Chat." You'll see a list of 12 different chatrooms that you can participate in. You'll also notice that a few have check marks by them. These checkmarks mean you are subscribed to that chatroom, so you'll see every chat from these rooms in the white box at the very top of the game. The color of the chat will tell you which chatroom the message came from. If you want to enter one of these chatrooms from the "Chat" menu, just tap it.

<a name="Messaging" id="Messaging"></a><h2> Messaging </h2>
<p>Often times, you'll want to send a Private Message to another player. PMs are very useful. Many players prefer that you send a short PM before requesting passage on their land. In fact, a short introductory PM is almost always a good idea if you are going to be playing near someone else.
</p><p>Here are the several ways you can send a Private Message to another player. 
</p>
<ol><li> Go to "Menu" &gt; "Inbox." Then tap the red arrow in the upper right and select "Send Message."
</li><li> Go to "Menu" &gt; "Players." Here you can search through other PK players by different categories including your Friends and Enemies. Tap someone's name in these lists to get an option to send them a message. 
</li><li> If you tap on any other player's building or avatar in the main game display, you'll have the option to send them a Private Message.
</li><li> If you are viewing someone's profile, there is a button that says "Message Player"
</li><li> In a chatroom, you can tap someone's name and you'll see the option to send them a PM
</li></ol>
<a name="Social_Feed" id="Social_Feed"></a><h2>Social Feed</h2>
<ul><li> Can be turned off by going to your Settings (in-game) or your Preferences (profile)
</li><li> The Social Feed splits up the Messages Menu into 3 different categories
</li><li> Messages
<ul><li> This is the same messaging system listed above
</li><li> Personal Messages or Messages with unique Actions (like Passage Requests) will show up in this section
</li><li> You can Delete, Comment, Mark Read, Etc.
</li><li> When active you will receive less Automatic/PK messages to this section
</li></ul>
</li><li> Updates
<ul><li> This is a tab specifically for Updates that are relevant to your character
</li><li> A number of Automatic Messages (like Flag Attack) notifications have been moved to this section
</li><li> These messages can even be Shared with your Friends using the "Share Action" on them
</li><li> You'll notice unique Icons to differentiate between Locked, Shared, Kingdom, and City Updates
</li><li> After viewing an Update, it will eventually be moved and sorted into your "Older" Archive to revisit them if needed
</li></ul>
</li><li> Events
<ul><li> This is the fun, socially-focused tab; here you'll be able to see what your Friends have been up to
</li><li> Events such as making Friends or Shared Items from the Updates tab will show up here for all of your Friends/Kingdom/City Members to see
</li><li> You and your Friends can then Comment on the Event to spark a discussion
</li><li> You can also "Level Up" the Event to show that you're a fan of it and keep an eye on additional comments or related Events
</li><li> When Events become too common, they will get Grouped up so you won't have to worry on missing anything
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Current list of potential Feed Entries can be found here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413213509/http://guide.parallelkingdom.com/index.php/List_of_Items_Shareable_via_Social_Feed" title="List of Items Shareable via Social Feed">List of Items Shareable via Social Feed</a>

<a name="Group_Hunting" id="Group_Hunting"></a><h2> Group Hunting </h2>
<p>One of the features in PK is the ability to join and battle with players anywhere in the world, regardless of where you are.
</p>
<a name="Inviting_Another_Player" id="Inviting_Another_Player"></a><h3> Inviting Another Player </h3>
<p>Sending an invite is just as easy as sending a Private Message. In fact they are done the exact same way. To invite another player, send them a Private Message and when typing in the message, just be sure to select the box that says, "Invite to Visit?" Now just tap "Send" and wait for the recipient to accept your invitation.
</p><p>If you receive an Invite message from another player, go to "Menu" &gt; "Inbox" and tap the Invite <img src="./Playing With Others - Guide_files/message_invite.png" alt="message_invite.png">  message. If you choose to pay the Roc Feather cost and accept the Invite, you will be instantly transported to the other player. When you arrive, you will be automatically placed in a group with the player that invited you. Now you can travel, hunt together, and receive sweet gold bonuses for group hunting.
</p>
<a name="Group_Reward_Bonus" id="Group_Reward_Bonus"></a><h3> Group Reward Bonus </h3>
<p>When working in a group Gold is shared amongst everyone participating in killing a monster. You also get a gold bonus for killing things in a group.
</p><p>The bonus is calculated based on the number of aggressive people on the parties invite, OR: the number of players attacking the same monster
</p><p><br>
</p>
<ul><li> A group of 2 gets 50% more gold.
</li><li> A group of 3 gets 95% more gold.
</li><li> A group of 4 gets 135% more gold
</li><li> A group of 5 gets 170% more gold.
</li><li> A group of 6 or larger gets 200% more gold.
</li></ul>
<a name="Weekly_Competitions_--_Trophy_Hats" id="Weekly_Competitions_--_Trophy_Hats"></a><h2> <img src="./Playing With Others - Guide_files/hat_monster_kills.png" alt="hat_monster_kills.png"> Weekly Competitions -- Trophy Hats </h2>
<p>Every Sunday at midnight (US Central time) a new set of weekly competitions begins. These competitions consist of ranking everyone in PK on 20 different statistical categories. At the end of the week, the highest ranking player in each category earns a very rare and very coveted Trophy Hat that their avatar can proudly wear for the rest of their career. Each category has a unique Trophy Hat that goes along with what is being ranked (i.e., the player that gets the most people to study at their library earns the "Conan the Librarian Hat").
</p><p>Use the Player's Lists and Profiles described below to see how you are ranking against the rest of Parallel Kingdom.
</p>
<a name="Players_Lists" id="Players_Lists"></a><h2> Players Lists </h2>
<p>By tapping "Menu" &gt; "Players" you'll see a list of different categories of players. At the top are your Friends and Enemies lists. Then you see a list of all the members in your city. Next, you see the four global lists of lifetime rankings in Gold, Flags, Levels, and Oil production. If you venture lower, you'll see the Trophy Hat rankings for all the weekly competitive categories.
</p><p>After you select the Player List you want to view, you'll notice that each player entry shows a grey or green dot next to the current look of their avatar. Grey means the player is currently offline, green means they are online. From any of the lists, you can easily tap a player's name and it will bring you to their profile page.
</p><p><br>
</p>
<a name="Profile_Pages" id="Profile_Pages"></a><h2> Profile Pages </h2>
<p>Every player in Parallel Kingdom gets a Profile Page. You can access and edit your own by going to "Menu" &gt; "Profile." If you want to edit your status message, tap the red arrow in the upper right corner and select "Update Status"
</p><p>When viewing other players' profiles, the red arrow also allows you to do several things:
</p>
<ul><li>Send Gold to the player
</li><li>Send Invite to the player
</li><li>Send a Private Message to the player
</li><li>If the player is in your Kingdom, you'll also see several options associated with that
</li></ul>
<p>Profile Pages show a lot of useful information about a player including:
Their name and flag color, current status message, which city they are a member of, when  they last played, how long they've been playing, their avatar's gender, and their current lifetime stats in gold, flags, oil wells, and levels earned.
</p><p><br>
Further down the Profile page, you'll also be able to see the player's current rankings in each of the weekly Trophy Hat rankings along with any Trophy Hats they've managed to earn. There are also buttons to view lists of the player's current "Friends" and "Enemies."
</p>
<a name="Friends_and_Enemies" id="Friends_and_Enemies"></a><h2> <img src="./Playing With Others - Guide_files/player_list_friends.png" alt="player_list_friends.png"> <img src="./Playing With Others - Guide_files/player_list_enemies.png" alt="player_list_enemies.png"> Friends and Enemies </h2>
<p>In the Age of Emergence you have the ability to easily keep track of your fellow friends and enemies. A friend or enemy status is always mutual. In other words, if someone is your friend, you are their friend. If someone makes you their enemy, they are automatically your enemy. 
</p><p>As in real life, enemies are very easily created. All you have to do is attack someone or one of their buildings, and you will make a new enemy automatically. Similarly, anyone that attacks you or your buildings, will become your enemy.
</p><p>Making friends is a little tougher. To do this, you have to visit the other player's Profile Page and use the red arrow in the upper right to "Make Friend." Then they will receive a Private Message saying that you requested to be their friend. If they accept, you will both become friends. If you are currently enemies and wish to call a truce, the process is similar - use the red arrow on the player's profile page and tap "Make Peace." The player receives a PM and has to accept it. If they do, then you will become neutral toward each other (not friends nor enemies).
</p>
<a name="Referring_Your_Friends" id="Referring_Your_Friends"></a><h2> Referring Your Friends </h2>
<p>Referring others to play PK is a great way to get yourself some free <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413213509/http://guide.parallelkingdom.com/index.php/Food" title="Food">Food</a> (for each successful referral). You'll get 40 free Food each time they level up (max of 400 free food per referral). Each of your referred players also gets 1000 Gold, so its cool for them too.
</p>
<a name="Option_1" id="Option_1"></a><h3> Option 1 </h3>
<p>Go to "Menu" &gt;&gt; "Get Food" &gt;&gt; "Share."  You'll see a pre-written referral e-mail containing your unique referral code. Just put your friend's e-mail address at the top and send the message.
</p>
<a name="Option_2" id="Option_2"></a><h3> Option 2 </h3>
<p>You can also copy down your referral code and get the word out any other way you want, as long as new people start playing.
</p><p>If you were referred by someone, to enter in a referral code, talk to the Monk at the end of the tutorial. Just choose "Enter Referral Code" and type in the code the other player gave you. Just make sure to enter the code <b> <i>before</i> </b> you are done with the first tutorial. You'll get 1,000 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413213509/http://guide.parallelkingdom.com/index.php/Gold" title="Gold">Gold</a> and they'll get 40 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413213509/http://guide.parallelkingdom.com/index.php/Food" title="Food">Food</a> each time you level up!
