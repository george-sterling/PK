  <h1>Mourning Trees and Berries</h1>

  <h2>Mourning Berry</h2>
  <p>
    A Mourning Berry is a magically healing fruit that can be found on Mourning Trees scattered throughout the Parallel Kingdom world. Harvesting a Mourning Berry from a Mourning Tree will add one Berry to your inventory for each tree.
  </p>
  <p>
    Berries can be used to heal yourself, heal your pets, heal your Summoned Trolls, or plant new Mourning Trees by creating Mourning Tree Saplings. Additionally, if you have Troll Lore Level 3 or access to a Troll Embassy in your City, you can use Berries to "Make Peace With Trolls."
  </p>
  <p>
    It's worth noting that with Warden Knowledge Level 3, there is a chance to harvest additional Berries when collecting from Mourning Trees.
  </p>

  <h2>Obtaining Berries</h2>
  <p>
    Apart from harvesting Berries from Mourning Trees, you can occasionally find them after defeating specific creatures in Parallel Kingdom. The creatures known to drop Berries are Trolls and Mistleterrors.
